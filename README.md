# Guille Ojeda’s website

A bilingual work showcase built with Astro. English is at `/`, Spanish at `/es/`. The generated site is hosted in private S3 behind CloudFront and published by GitHub Actions.

## Local development

Use Node 24 LTS (see `.nvmrc`) and npm.

```sh
npm ci
SITE_URL=https://guilleojeda.com npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Astro. `SITE_URL` controls page metadata; navigation between local pages uses relative links. For a production build, supply the actual public HTTPS origin without a path, query, or fragment.

```sh
SITE_URL=https://guilleojeda.com npm run verify
SITE_URL=https://guilleojeda.com npm run preview
```

`verify` runs type/content checks, focused tests, a production build, and checks of the generated output. `preview` serves that build locally. GitHub uses the same verification command with the deployed origin configured in repository variables.

## Update content

Edit the small files in `src/content/`:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `profile.json` | Bio, role, community activities, course, interface copy, primary links, and metadata |
| `projects.json` | Selected work and its destinations |
| `talks.json` | Talks, workshops, podcasts, training, and video appearances; highlight selection and public links |
| `books.json` | Authored books, descriptions, and per-book publication/status labels |

Keep common identifiers, dates, and URLs in each record once. Put the two translations beside each other under `en` and `es`. To add a talk or project, copy an existing record, give it a distinct ID, and update its facts, links, and both translations. Set a project’s `featured: true` to show a card; other projects appear in the compact work archive. Page components should not need edits. Publication titles can stay in their original language.

Every record in `talks.json` appears in the complete archive, grouped by its numeric `year`. Set `featured: true` for a highlight card; provide paired `event`, `format`, `title`, and `text`. A repeated talk at a different event is a separate record. Add `href` and a paired `cta` when a public recording, deck, or event page exists; otherwise omit both. A missing recording does not require omitting a supported appearance.

Community leadership and organizing records are in `profile.json` → `about.activities`. Book `meta` labels distinguish published work from a book in progress. The historical course lives under `authorship.courseTitle`, `courseMeta`, and `courseText`; its unavailable status should remain accurate.

For a role change, update the paired copy in `profile.json`: `hero.intro` (opening bio), `about.intro`, `about.facts[0].value` (Now row), and `site.title`/`site.description` (metadata). `hero.roleContext` controls the organization/team label. These are editable prose, so update both languages together.

The portrait and other public assets live in the repository. Keep alternative text accurate when replacing an image. Do not add uncertain release dates, availability claims, or live audience counts without confirming them.

Run `npm run verify` with `SITE_URL` set before publishing a content change. See [the website behavior](docs/intent/website.md) for the content and operating decisions.

## AWS setup

Infrastructure is defined in `infra/template.json`. `infra/cloudfront-routing.js` is the authoritative routing source; the renderer embeds it into a deployable template so there is no second copy to maintain.

Use a temporary AWS operator session for the intended account and `us-east-1`. Inspect the existing GitHub OIDC provider before setup:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers
```

If the account already has the provider for `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, pass its ARN as `GitHubOidcProviderArn`. Do not create another provider or replace one owned by another application. If none exists, the stack can create it with `CreateOidcProviderIfMissing=true`.

For a new provider:

```sh
guille_stack_template="$(mktemp)"
node scripts/render-infra.mjs --output "$guille_stack_template"
aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body "file://$guille_stack_template" --region us-east-1
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name guilleojeda-website \
  --template-file "$guille_stack_template" \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides CreateOidcProviderIfMissing=true
rm "$guille_stack_template"
```

For reuse, replace the parameter override with `GitHubOidcProviderArn=YOUR_EXISTING_PROVIDER_ARN`. Keep the same provider choice on later stack updates. Setup creates private storage, CloudFront routing/cache configuration, and a restricted site-deployment role. It does not upload the site or modify custom-domain DNS.

Read the outputs after the stack finishes:

```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name guilleojeda-website \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
  --output table
```

Configure these GitHub Actions **repository variables**:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` |
| `AWS_ROLE_ARN` | `DeploymentRoleArn` output |
| `S3_BUCKET` | `BucketName` output |
| `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` | `DistributionId` output |
| `SITE_URL` | `https://` followed by `DistributionDomainName` |

These values are identifiers, not credentials. For example, `gh variable set AWS_REGION --body us-east-1`. GitHub assumes the deployment role through OIDC; do not add AWS access-key secrets to the repository.

## Publish and recover

Pull requests verify and build. A push to `main` verifies, packages the exact build artifact, and deploys it through the main-only AWS role. Deployment uploads assets before HTML, retains old hashed assets, invalidates CloudFront, and checks the live English and Spanish pages. A superseded push does not overwrite a newer commit. Missing variables and failed checks fail explicitly.

Infrastructure updates use the versioned CloudFormation template under the operator session. Normal site updates use CI; do not manually upload `dist/` to bypass the workflow.

If a deployment fails, inspect the failing Actions step and its error before retrying. After repairing an upload or invalidation failure, rerun the workflow for the current intended commit. The operations are repeatable, but multi-object uploads are not atomic, so a failed run may leave mixed files until the successful retry.

To roll back a published content/code change, revert its commit on `main` and let the same workflow publish the revert. Old hashed assets are retained for cached pages and rollback. Do not delete them merely because they are absent from the latest build.

The initial live endpoint is CloudFront’s HTTPS domain. The existing `guilleojeda.com`, blog, and mail DNS remain separate until the approved custom-domain migration is delivered. This repository does not silently perform that migration during a content deployment.
